# Hi all! this is the api that starts the twilio emergeny call, made in nodejs

please clone the repo using git clone, and use npm install to install stuff, and then make a .env file to add the twilio auth credentials, inspiration from the main .js file, and a cool node index.js should make it go up and running!

make sure to leave a ‚≠ê
- thanks
